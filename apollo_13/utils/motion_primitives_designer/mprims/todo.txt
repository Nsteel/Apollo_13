1. when decreasing angular resolution: change the discrete angle to one of the two nearer angles
2. place multiple primitives
3. export to motion primitive format
4. autogeneration of primitives for other discrete angles
5. view turning radius parameters for given resolutions
6. scrollable window
7. fix bug with angles not updating when num_angles is changed
8. make pluginable curve generators
9. click and drag arrows instead of drawing the tangent line: left click for translation and right-click for rotation
    - show a ghost arrow for where the arrow will snap to in discrete land in both orientation and position
10. stop hardcoding the shape of the start and the goal and move the picking/collision detection out of widget
11. marching squares selection visualization
12. tetris like "next piece" window for goals
